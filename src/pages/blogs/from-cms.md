Hi! My name is Yuya Oiwa and I'm a software engineer in Tokyo, Japan. This is my first attempt to write a personal blog, and I will try to update as frequently as I can (Maybe around 3 posts a week?). The blogs will mainly be a mix between Japanese and English so please bear with me!

I will mainly be writing about my daily finding of interesting technologies, and will try to explain everything in explicit/ELI5 detail as possible. I'm a newbie, so things might seem obvious but after all it's for myself.

Thanks!
